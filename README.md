# a10_5015_mount
Mounting panel for 5015 fan on a Geeetech A10 3D printer

Uses OpenSCAD to mount a 5015 fan on a Geetech A10 with fan pointing directly in towards extruder.

*This is very much still a work in progress*

Can generate a mounting to create any of the following:
 - an adapter for using a 5015 fan with existing cooler options
 - a cooler to match with this adapter
 - a fan mount with an integrated cooler nozzle

Options are present for changing the angle and position of the fan itself.

The furthest screwhole from the base can be included in the mount or ignored.

Visual options include picturing the fan or the extruder against the model, and the model can also be changed to show the airflow alone.

Most parameters are configurable, although some work still needs to be done on this.

*OpenSCAD 2019.05 or later will show these options in a customizer pane*

There is currently no warning provided if parameter combinations will cause issues

Further work is intended to add alternative airflow options to this model - currently only one option is present.
